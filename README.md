# 🚨 Security Incident Response using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

**Date:** September 2025

### Project Overview

This project applied the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to analyze and document a simulated **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)** attack. The work involved:

* Identifying the scope and impact of an **ICMP flood** that disrupted all internal network operations.
* Implementing **protective measures** such as firewall rules and **IDS/IPS configurations**.
* Enhancing **detection capabilities** through source IP verification and network monitoring.

The report also outlined effective **response strategies**, including system isolation, log analysis, and escalation to management, while developing **recovery procedures** that prioritized the restoration of critical services and recommended long-term resilience measures.
